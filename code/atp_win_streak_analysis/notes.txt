OVERALL NOTE
I THINK WE SHOULD DO ALL OF OUR ANALYSIS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TENNIS ONCE AS WELL. DIFFERENCES IN THESE LEVELS COULD MATTER, AND IT WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION TO THE PREDICTION MODEL


# Experiment 1
# This experiment will analyse any direct correlation between winning streak with either winning or losing a game.
# It is expected that a high win streak will correlate to a higher probability of winning.

# Experiment 2
# For the second experiment I am curious about the probability of winning a match, given that you are on a certain win streak.
# For this I will calculate proportions of matches won on a certain win streak. This will give a nice plot hopefully, showing increased odds for higher streaks.

Reflection on experiment 1 and 2
In experiment 1 very low correlation was found between the win streak and match outcome, while in experiment 2 we 







It is important to note that win streaks might be very tournament dependent. It might be wise to seperate winstreaks in tournaments from regular winstreaks, 
since you cannot go on a losing streak in a tournament.

QUESTIONS
For experiment two you find that there are a couple of very high winstreaks, probably like two or three, 
causing low probabilities for winning when on a high streak. How to fit a line through this, or deal with this. 
Should I get rid of the datapoints.
