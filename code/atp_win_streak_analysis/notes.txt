OVERALL NOTE
I THINK WE SHOULD DO ALL OF OUR ANALYSIS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TENNIS ONCE AS WELL. DIFFERENCES IN THESE LEVELS COULD MATTER, AND IT WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION TO THE PREDICTION MODEL


# Experiment 1
# This experiment will analyse any direct correlation between winning streak with either winning or losing a game.
# It is expected that a high win streak will correlate to a higher probability of winning.

# Experiment 2
# For the second experiment I am curious about the probability of winning a match, given that you are on a certain win streak.
# For this I will calculate proportions of matches won on a certain win streak. This will give a nice plot hopefully, showing increased odds for higher streaks.

Reflection on experiment 1 and 2
In experiment 1 very low correlation was found between the win streak and match outcome, 
while in experiment 2 results showed that higher streaks do get higher win rates and win/loss ratios.
This discrepency is likely due to the fact that most players cannot accumulate high streaks, only the best players can do this. So you are basically selecting the best players based on their win streaks.
To get the real effect of win streaks, you have to condition for skill level.

# Experiment 3
In experiment 3 I will condition on skill level by binning players into different skill categories. Then within each category, analyse the role of win streaks







It is important to note that win streaks might be very tournament dependent. It might be wise to seperate winstreaks in tournaments from regular winstreaks, 
since you cannot go on a losing streak in a tournament.

QUESTIONS
For experiment two you find that there are a couple of very high winstreaks, probably like two or three, 
causing low probabilities for winning when on a high streak. How to fit a line through this, or deal with this. 
Should I get rid of the datapoints.
